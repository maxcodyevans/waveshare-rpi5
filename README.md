Introduction: Waveshare Thermal Camera for Raspberry Pi 5

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and using the Waveshare Thermal Camera with the Raspberry Pi 5. The Waveshare Thermal Camera leverages the Raspberry Pi's processing power to capture thermal images and data, enabling a variety of applications. This guide is intended for users with basic Raspberry Pi experience.

Compatibility

This guide assumes the following hardware and software environment:

    Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0
    Operating System: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
    Kernel: Linux 6.6.20+rpt-rpi-v8
    Architecture: arm64
    Waveshare Thermal Camera: HAT long-wave IR thermal imaging camera modules with the 40PIN GPIO header with 80(H)Ã—62(V) temperature measuring pixels
    Virtual Environment: While the original instructions use a Python virtual environment, this guide will use conda. Ensure you have miniconda installed on your Raspberry Pi.

Setting Up the Virtual Environment

'''

conda create --name myenv -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate myenv

'''

This creates a conda environment named myenv with Python 3.11.  We will activate this environment throughout the guide for managing dependencies.

Next Steps

The guide will continue with detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and using the Waveshare Thermal Camera with your Raspberry Pi 5.
